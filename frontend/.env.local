### **Step 5: Run the Application**

You are now ready to start both servers. You will need two separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory.
    * Run the command:
        ```bash
        npx ts-node src/server.ts
        ```
    * You should see the output:
        ```
        Connected to the PostgreSQL database!
        Backend server is running on http://localhost:5000
        ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    * Open a **new** terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    * Run the command:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    * You should see output indicating the server is ready, typically:
        ```
        - ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
